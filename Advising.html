	<p> 	
	<strong> For Tutoring Help </strong> 		
	<ul>
		<li> The Academic Services Center offers tutoring services . Joining the "Tutoring Service" site on ILEarn.  
		<br> Click on Membership,  Click Joinable Sites,  Click the drop-down box to show 200 sites , Scroll & find Tutoring Services, click Join
		<li> This semesters Computer Science tutoring sessions are:  T.B.D. 
		<li> There is also the programming  lab in Hancock.  It is VIRTUAL in Fall 2021.		
	</ul>

<!---------  Courses      -------->	
    <div class="block2" ->
	<strong> For Course Registration </strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Sections: On Ground:100-299 ---  Flexible Hybrid: 6xx ---Online:7xx --- Remote:8xx ---  Blended Synchronous 9xx
                          Abroad:180-190 --------Adult Students:743x ---  
		<br> &nbsp;
		<li> Plan early. Review  your degreeworks to plan the next semester courses. Use the Schedule Planner tool. It's designed to help create an
			 ideal schedule, taking into account other events of daytime preferences (work times, athletic practice, etc.). 
		<li> When planning (and using Schedule Planner)  write down the 5 digit CRN #’s for each course you plan to register for. 
		<li> As classes often close quickly, have back-up schedules or back-up courses ready at registration time to help have a positive registration experience. 
		<br> &nbsp;
		<li> Registration dates are based on EARNED (completed) credits. 
		     In Degree works, this is the total credits noted in the top bar, but subtract your current in progress credits.
			 Make sure you pick some alternates in case the course you desire is not  available.
		<li> Course waivers must be submitted & approved BEFORE registration.  The "Prerequisite Permit" (OVERRIDE) form is found on the STUDENT RESOURCES option 
		     on the Banner  STUDENT tab. 
		<br> &nbsp;
		<li> Remember that your full time tuition pays for 16 credits.  If your schedule is only 15 credits, you can fill it with a light and fun one-credit course.  These will 	
			help fill out your total degree requirements. You can find the one- and two-credit courses by using the ADVANCED tab of the LOOK UP CLASSES option in Banner.
		<li> Email me  a draft of your proposed course schedule, including other pertinent information, such as employment hours or other commitments.
		<li> At some point we must communicate before I release the hold, which will allow you to register for courses.  We can meet by Zoom or just an e-mail 
		    (if that is what you prefer).  Ensure that you reach out to me early so nothing delays your registration.

	<strong> Advice on Internships <strong> 
	<ul> 
	    <li> Explore the CS/ITS Careers iLearn site. There are resume templates you can download and fill out.
		<li> Review the site's essay on resumes and personal projects.
		<li> Once your resume is complete, have it reviewed by faculty for suggestions.
		<li> The Help Desk and ResNet will hire and train inexperienced students. It’s a good IT experience and is commonly a springboard to off-campus internships 
		     and associated coolness.
		<li> Don't be afraid to apply to internships where you don't meet all the requirements.  It's good experience, and there is always a chance that you'll be accepted.
